Programming in Scala
====================

Chapter 1
=========
A Scalable Language

The name Scala stands for "scalable language." You can apply Scala to a 
  wide range of programming tasks, from writing small scripts to building large 
  systems.

Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a 
  statically typed language.

1.1 A LANGUAGE THAT GROWS ON YOU
--------------------------------
Growing new types
Growing new control constructs

Java comes with a rich, thread-based concurrency library. Scala programs can use
  it like any other Java API. However, Akka is an additional Scala library that 
  implements an actor model similar to Erlang's.

1.2 WHAT MAKES SCALA SCALABLE?
------------------------------
Combination of object-oriented and functional programming

Scala is object-oriented
Traits are like interfaces in Java, but they can also have method implementations 
  and even fields.

Scala is functional
Functional programming is guided by two main ideas:
1. The first idea is that functions are first-class values.
2. The second main idea of functional programming is that the operations of a 
  program should map input values to output values rather than change data in 
  place

1.3 WHY SCALA?
--------------
Scala is compatible
Scala programs compile to JVM bytecodes. Their run-time performance is usually 
  on par with Java programs. Scala code can call Java methods, access Java fields,
  inherit from Java classes, and implement Java interfaces.

Scala is concise

Scala is high-level

Scala is statically typed

1.4 SCALA'S ROOTS
-----------------
Scala's design has been influenced by many programming languages and ideas in 
  programming language research.

First Steps in Scala

STEP 1. LEARN TO USE THE SCALA INTERPRETER
------------------------------------------
All of Java's primitive types have corresponding classes in the scala package.

STEP 2. DEFINE SOME VARIABLES
-----------------------------
Scala has two kinds of variables, vals and vars. A val is similar to a final 
  variable in Java. Once initialized, a val can never be reassigned. A var, by 
  contrast, is similar to a non-final variable in Java.

STEP 3. DEFINE SOME FUNCTIONS
-----------------------------
Function definitions start with def.
If the function is recursive, you must explicitly specify the function's result 
  type.

Scala's Unit type is similar to Java's void type

STEP 4. WRITE SOME SCALA SCRIPTS
--------------------------------
Command line arguments to a Scala script are available via a Scala array named 
  args. In Scala, arrays are zero based, and you access an element by specifying 
  an index in parentheses.

STEP 5. LOOP WITH WHILE; DECIDE WITH IF
---------------------------------------
Note that Java's + +i and i++ don't work in Scala. To increment in Scala, you 
  need to say either i = i + 1 or i += 1.

STEP 6. ITERATE WITH FOREACH AND FOR
------------------------------------
Scala enables you to program imperatively, but as you get to know Scala better, 
  you'll likely often find yourself programming in a more functional style.

STEP 7. PARAMETERIZE ARRAYS WITH TYPES
--------------------------------------
When you define a variable with val, the variable can't be reassigned, but the 
  object to which it refers could potentially still be changed.

If a method takes only one parameter, you can call it without a dot or parentheses.

Scala doesn't technically have operator overloading, because it doesn't actually 
  have operators in the traditional sense. Instead, characters such as +, -, *, 
  and / can be used in method names.

When you apply parentheses surrounding one or more values to a variable, Scala 
  will transform the code into an invocation of a method named apply on that 
  variable.

Scala achieves a conceptual simplicity by treating everything, from arrays to 
  expressions, as objects with methods.

STEP 8. USE LISTS
-----------------
Scala array is a mutable sequence of objects that all share the same type. 
  An Array[String] contains only strings, for example. Although you can't change 
  the length of an array after it is instantiated, you can change its element 
  values. Thus, arrays are mutable objects.

For an immutable sequence of objects that share the same type you can use Scala's 
  List class.

:: is a method of its right operand

WHY NOT APPEND TO LISTS?
The time it takes to append to a list grows linearly with the size of the list, 
  whereas prepending with :: takes constant time.

STEP 9. USE TUPLES
------------------
Like lists, tuples are immutable, but unlike lists, tuples can contain different 
  types of elements.

STEP 10. USE SETS AND MAPS
--------------------------
Scala also provides mutable and immutable alternatives for sets and maps, but 
  uses the same simple names for both versions.

STEP 11. LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNCTIONAL STYLE
------------------------------------------------
If code contains any vars, it is probably in an imperative style. If the code 
  contains no vars at all—i.e., it contains only vals—it is probably in a 
  functional style. One way to move towards a functional style, therefore, is 
  to try to program without vars.

If a function isn't returning any interesting value, which is what a result 
  type of Unit means, the only way that function can make a difference in the 
  world is through some kind of side effect.

A BALANCED ATTITUDE FOR SCALA PROGRAMMERS
-----------------------------------------
Prefer vals, immutable objects, and methods without side effects. Reach for 
  them first. Use vars, mutable objects, and methods with side effects when you 
  have a specific need and justification for them.

STEP 12. READ LINES FROM A FILE
-------------------------------
Use scala.io.Source library to read lines from a file.
