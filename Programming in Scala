Programming in Scala
====================

Chapter 1
=========
A Scalable Language

The name Scala stands for "scalable language." You can apply Scala to a 
  wide range of programming tasks, from writing small scripts to building large 
  systems.

Scala is a blend of object-oriented and functional programming concepts in a 
  statically typed language.

1.1 A LANGUAGE THAT GROWS ON YOU
--------------------------------
Growing new types
Growing new control constructs

Java comes with a rich, thread-based concurrency library. Scala programs can use
  it like any other Java API. However, Akka is an additional Scala library that 
  implements an actor model similar to Erlang's.

1.2 WHAT MAKES SCALA SCALABLE?
------------------------------
Combination of object-oriented and functional programming

Scala is object-oriented
Traits are like interfaces in Java, but they can also have method implementations 
  and even fields.

Scala is functional
Functional programming is guided by two main ideas:
1. The first idea is that functions are first-class values.
2. The second main idea of functional programming is that the operations of a 
  program should map input values to output values rather than change data in 
  place

1.3 WHY SCALA?
--------------
Scala is compatible
Scala programs compile to JVM bytecodes. Their run-time performance is usually 
  on par with Java programs. Scala code can call Java methods, access Java fields,
  inherit from Java classes, and implement Java interfaces.

Scala is concise

Scala is high-level

Scala is statically typed

1.4 SCALA'S ROOTS
-----------------
Scala's design has been influenced by many programming languages and ideas in 
  programming language research.

First Steps in Scala

STEP 1. LEARN TO USE THE SCALA INTERPRETER
------------------------------------------
All of Java's primitive types have corresponding classes in the scala package.

STEP 2. DEFINE SOME VARIABLES
-----------------------------
Scala has two kinds of variables, vals and vars. A val is similar to a final 
  variable in Java. Once initialized, a val can never be reassigned. A var, by 
  contrast, is similar to a non-final variable in Java.

STEP 3. DEFINE SOME FUNCTIONS
-----------------------------
Function definitions start with def.
If the function is recursive, you must explicitly specify the function's result 
  type.

Scala's Unit type is similar to Java's void type

STEP 4. WRITE SOME SCALA SCRIPTS
--------------------------------
Command line arguments to a Scala script are available via a Scala array named 
  args. In Scala, arrays are zero based, and you access an element by specifying 
  an index in parentheses.

STEP 5. LOOP WITH WHILE; DECIDE WITH IF
---------------------------------------
Note that Java's + +i and i++ don't work in Scala. To increment in Scala, you 
  need to say either i = i + 1 or i += 1.

STEP 6. ITERATE WITH FOREACH AND FOR
------------------------------------
Scala enables you to program imperatively, but as you get to know Scala better, 
  you'll likely often find yourself programming in a more functional style.

STEP 7. PARAMETERIZE ARRAYS WITH TYPES
--------------------------------------
When you define a variable with val, the variable can't be reassigned, but the 
  object to which it refers could potentially still be changed.

If a method takes only one parameter, you can call it without a dot or parentheses.

Scala doesn't technically have operator overloading, because it doesn't actually 
  have operators in the traditional sense. Instead, characters such as +, -, *, 
  and / can be used in method names.

When you apply parentheses surrounding one or more values to a variable, Scala 
  will transform the code into an invocation of a method named apply on that 
  variable.

Scala achieves a conceptual simplicity by treating everything, from arrays to 
  expressions, as objects with methods.

STEP 8. USE LISTS
-----------------
Scala array is a mutable sequence of objects that all share the same type. 
  An Array[String] contains only strings, for example. Although you can't change 
  the length of an array after it is instantiated, you can change its element 
  values. Thus, arrays are mutable objects.

For an immutable sequence of objects that share the same type you can use Scala's 
  List class.

:: is a method of its right operand

WHY NOT APPEND TO LISTS?
The time it takes to append to a list grows linearly with the size of the list, 
  whereas prepending with :: takes constant time.

STEP 9. USE TUPLES
------------------
Like lists, tuples are immutable, but unlike lists, tuples can contain different 
  types of elements.

STEP 10. USE SETS AND MAPS
--------------------------
Scala also provides mutable and immutable alternatives for sets and maps, but 
  uses the same simple names for both versions.

STEP 11. LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNCTIONAL STYLE
------------------------------------------------
If code contains any vars, it is probably in an imperative style. If the code 
  contains no vars at all—i.e., it contains only vals—it is probably in a 
  functional style. One way to move towards a functional style, therefore, is 
  to try to program without vars.

If a function isn't returning any interesting value, which is what a result 
  type of Unit means, the only way that function can make a difference in the 
  world is through some kind of side effect.

A BALANCED ATTITUDE FOR SCALA PROGRAMMERS
-----------------------------------------
Prefer vals, immutable objects, and methods without side effects. Reach for 
  them first. Use vars, mutable objects, and methods with side effects when you 
  have a specific need and justification for them.

STEP 12. READ LINES FROM A FILE
-------------------------------
Use scala.io.Source library to read lines from a file.

Chapter 4
=========
Classes and Objects

4.1 CLASSES, FIELDS, AND METHODS
--------------------------------
One important characteristic of method parameters in Scala is that they are vals, 
  not vars.

In the absence of any explicit return statement, a Scala method returns the last 
  value computed by the method.

A side effect is generally defined as mutating state somewhere external to the 
  method or performing an I/O action.

A method that is executed only for its side effects is known as a procedure.

4.2 SEMICOLON INFERENCE
-----------------------
Semicolon is required if you write multiple statements on a single line

4.3 SINGLETON OBJECTS
---------------------
A singleton object definition looks like a class definition, except instead of 
  the keyword class you use the keyword object.

When a singleton object shares the same name with a class, it is called that 
  class's companion object.

A singleton object that does not share the same name with a companion class is 
  called a standalone object.

One difference between classes and singleton objects is that singleton objects 
  cannot take parameters, whereas classes can.

4.4 A SCALA APPLICATION
-----------------------
To run a Scala program, you must supply the name of a standalone singleton object 
  with a main method that takes one parameter, an Array[String], and has a result 
  type of Unit.

One difference between Scala and Java is that whereas Java requires you to put a 
  public class in a file named after the class—for example, you'd put class 
  SpeedRacer in file SpeedRacer.java—in Scala, you can name .scala files anything 
  you want, no matter what Scala classes or code you put in them.

4.5 THE APP TRAIT
-----------------
To use the trait, you first write "extends App" after the name of your singleton 
  object. Then instead of writing a main method, you place the code you would 
  have put in the main method directly between the curly braces of the singleton 
  object.

Basic Types and Operations

5.1 SOME BASIC TYPES
--------------------
Scala's basic types have the exact same ranges as the corresponding types in Java.

5.2 LITERALS
------------
You start and end a raw string with three double quotation marks in a row (""").

5.3 STRING INTERPOLATION
------------------------
Its most common use case is to provide a concise and readable alternative to 
  string concatenation.

Scala provides two other string interpolators by default: raw and f.

5.4 OPERATORS ARE METHODS
-------------------------
Operators are actually just a nice syntax for ordinary method calls.

ANY METHOD CAN BE AN OPERATOR

In Scala, you can leave off empty parentheses on method calls.
The convention is that you include parentheses if the method has side effects, 
  such as println(), but you can leave them off if the method has no side effects, 
  such as toLowerCase invoked on aString

5.5 ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
-------------------------

5.6 RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL OPERATIONS
-------------------------------------
The && and || operations short-circuit as in Java: expressions built from these 
  operators are only evaluated as far as needed to determine the result.

If you want to evaluate the right hand side no matter what, use & and | instead.

5.7 BITWISE OPERATIONS
----------------------

5.8 OBJECT EQUALITY
-------------------

5.9 OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY
-----------------------------------------

5.10 RICH WRAPPERS
------------------
Operators in Scala are method calls, and that implicit conversions to rich 
  variants exist for Scala's basic types that add even more useful methods.

Chapter 6
=========
Functional Objects

6.1 A SPECIFICATION FOR CLASS RATIONAL
--------------------------------------

6.2 CONSTRUCTING A RATIONAL
---------------------------

IMMUTABLE OBJECT TRADE-OFFS
1. Immutable objects are often easier to reason about than mutable ones, because 
  they do not have complex state spaces that change over time.
2. You can pass immutable objects around quite freely, whereas you may need to 
  make defensive copies of mutable objects before passing them to other code.
3. There is no way for two threads concurrently accessing an immutable to corrupt 
  its state once it has been properly constructed, because no thread can change 
  the state of an immutable.
4. Immutable objects make safe hash table keys.

The main disadvantage of immutable objects is that they sometimes require that a 
  large object graph be copied, whereas an update could be done in its place.

The Scala compiler will compile any code you place in the class body, which isn't 
  part of a field or a method definition, into the primary constructor.

6.3 REIMPLEMENTING THE TOSTRING METHOD
--------------------------------------

6.4 CHECKING PRECONDITIONS
--------------------------
The require method takes one boolean parameter. If the passed value is true, 
  require will return normally. Otherwise, require will prevent the object 
  from being constructed by throwing an IllegalArgumentException.

6.5 ADDING FIELDS
-----------------

6.6 SELF REFERENCES
-------------------

6.7 AUXILIARY CONSTRUCTORS
--------------------------
In Scala, constructors other than the primary constructor are called auxiliary 
  constructors.

In Scala, every auxiliary constructor must invoke another constructor of the same 
  class as its first action. 

6.8 PRIVATE FIELDS AND METHODS
------------------------------

6.9 DEFINING OPERATORS
----------------------

6.10 IDENTIFIERS IN SCALA
-------------------------
Camel-case names of fields, method parameters, local variables, and functions 
  should start with a lower case letter, for example: length, flatMap, and s. 
  Camel-case names of classes and traits should start with an upper case letter, 
  for example: BigInt, List, and UnbalancedTreeMap.

6.11 METHOD OVERLOADING
-----------------------

6.12 IMPLICIT CONVERSIONS
-------------------------
You can create an implicit conversion that converts types when needed.
